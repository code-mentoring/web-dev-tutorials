# Add an Image and Give it Style  

## Story

One weekend, you're throwing a birthday party for your mother.
While decorating your house for the party, putting up balloons and and a big "Happy Birthday" banner, you remember
that you've arranged for a cake to baked by a local bakery, so you send your cousin to go to collect the cake.

Your cousin is from out of town though, so he asks you for directions to the bakery.
You write down a route, something like, go to the end of the street, turn left, etc.
When your cousin arrives at the bakery, he asks the baker for the cake which is referenced under your name.
The baker gladly passes him the cake and then your cousin returns back to your house with the cake in hand.

This is similar to how a web developer tells, or directs the computer to go get something and display it within the web browser.
For example, if the developer wants a certain image displayed, they must give directions to where the image can be found.
These are virtual directions, leading the computer along a virtual path within the computers file system or another computer's 
file system out on the internet.
