## Story

You are part of a website delivery team, made up of a project manager, designers, testers, and developers.
As a front-end web developer on this team, you have been tasked with turning the design into reality! 

## Task

- Write HTML and CSS code to create a web page that follows the design provided in "design.png"
- Content from the design is provided to you in "text.txt" and "cm.jfif"
- Your web page must be viewable in any web browser of your choice (e.g. firefox)

## Note from the Designer

Pay particular attention to the positioning of the content, i.e. we need the text to be centered on the screen.

## Challenge

See comment "Why doesn't this affect img?".

## Mentor Instructions

- Begin by telling the story
- Drag n drop "text.txt" into a web browser, point out lack of styles
- Add structure using HTML 
- No need for html/head/body tags; keep it simple
- Add style using CSS
- Lead to the challenge; engage learners by letting them solve this
