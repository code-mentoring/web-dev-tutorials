## Story

You are part of a website delivery team, made up of a project manager, designers, testers, and developers.
As a front-end web developer on this team, you have been tasked with turning the design into reality! 

## Task

- Write HTML and CSS code to create a web page that follows the design provided in "design.png"
- Content from the design is provided to you in "text.txt" and "cm.jfif"
- Your web page must be viewable in any web browser of your choice (e.g. firefox)

## Note from the Designer

Pay particular attention to the positioning of the content, i.e. we need the text to be centered on the screen.
