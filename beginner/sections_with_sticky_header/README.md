## Story

![Mountain Road](mountain_road.png)

Notice how this image is divided into three core sections.

- Sky on top
- Mountain and forest in the middle
- Road on the bottom

Imagine you're the photographer and you're walking down this road.
The road is at your feet and you don't pay much attention to it, perhaps looking down to view some minor details from time to time.
Your main focus of course is on the mountain and forest in the middle, but you're always aware of the blue sky above too.

From this, we can understand three key concepts of web design; HTML even has tags for them!

- [header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header)
- [main](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main)
- [footer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer)

## Task

- Markup header, main and footer sections
- Add background color to each section to make them distinctive
- Add width and height as desired
- Add fixed positioning to the header to make it "sticky", i.e. user is _**always aware of it**_ even when they scroll down
